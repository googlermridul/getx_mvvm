## Introduction

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern that separates the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic or back-end logic (the data model). This pattern helps in organizing code, making it more modular, maintainable, and testable.

GetX is a powerful Flutter package that simplifies state management, dependency injection, and route management, making it easier to implement the MVVM architecture.

## Features

-  Clean and structured code using MVVM architecture
-  State management with GetX
-  Dependency injection with GetX
-  Easy navigation with GetX routing
